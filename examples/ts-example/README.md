# Overlayed TypeScript Example

This is a simple example of using Overlayed with TypeScript.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the TypeScript code:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

- `main.ts` - The main application file
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

## Note

This example requires TypeScript types for the @overlayed/app package. Since these may not be
publicly available, we've included a basic type declaration in the main.ts file.
